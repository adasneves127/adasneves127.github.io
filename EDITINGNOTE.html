    <h1>How to Edit this page:</h1>
    <h2>What to use to do this?</h2>
    <h4>First, you need to get to the code of this website.</h4>
    <p>The code to this website can be found at <a href="https://github.com/adasneves127/adasneves127.github.io">this link.</a></p>
    <p>For editing access, you can either use my account, or create an account to propose a change.</p>

    <p>Navigate to the Category that the recipe falls under. These are the same as the Categories listed in the table.</p>
    <p>In this example, we will edit the Zuppa Toscana recipe.</p>

    <p>Click on the <code>.html</code> file that you want to edit. If the name of these files are too long, then the name of the page will be an abbreviation.</p>

    <p>If you click on the file you wish to edit, your screen should look like this.</p>
    <p>Here is a quick rundown of what these "&lt;" &amp; "&gt;" things mean.</p>
    <p>"&lt;" &amp; "&gt;"'s represent "tags." These tags denote how objects should be rendered while viewing. Different tags control diferent looks.</p>
    <p>A good analogy for this layout can be like a Word Document.</p>
    <p>We will start analyzing these from the top down. Any tag that has a slash (/) in it denotes a closing tag, which represents the end of its corresponding opening tag.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; -- This denotes which version of the HTML standard we are using. In this case, we are using just normal HTML.</li>
        <li>&lt;html lang="en"&gt; -- This tells the website that this is the start of the website, and that the text will all be English.</li>
        <li>&lt;head&gt; -- This is the heading of a website. It contains information about the website, as well as anything we bring in from outside this file.</li>
        <li>We are going to ignore the &lt;meta&gt; tags, as they contain specifics to tell the web browser what to expect...</li>
        <li>&lt;title&gt; -- This tag tells the web browser what to put on the tab of the webpage.</li>
        <li>&lt;link&gt; -- This is used to import our styling from other files. In this case, it saves me from putting the same code into each document.</li>
        <li>&lt;/head&gt; -- This is used to tell the browser that it is the end of the heading of our website.</li>
        <li>&lt;body&gt; -- The real meat & potatoes of our website will be within the body tag.</li>
        <li>&lt;div&gt; -- A division within the website, to which styles can be applied to.</li>
        <li>class -- This is another way to denote which styles get applied where. Styles can be applied to Tags, or classes.</li>
        <li>&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; -- These are different headers. Headers contain information that is usually considered more important, and thus, is rendered differently.</li>
        <li>&lt;ul&gt; -- This is an Unordered list. Rather than have numbers to show the start of each line, it will instead use bullet points.</li>
        <li>&lt;ol&gt; -- This is an Ordered list. Each line item within this will start the line with a number instead.</li>
        <li>&lt;li&gt; -- This is a Line Item, which is used to denote the start of a new element in our list.</li>
        <li>&lt;style&gt; -- This denotes new styling rules, not contained within our external file.</li>
        <li>&lt;script&gt; -- This denotes new scripting code to be run. This could include updating text on screen, and much more!</li>
        <li>&lt;br&gt; -- Line break, kinda like hitting the enter button.</li>
        <li>&lt;hr&gt; -- Horrizontal Rule, which will insert a solid line horrizontally across the screen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In some of these recipes, the ingredients will be in a table instead. The layout of a table is as such:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;table&gt; -- Everything that falls between this tag, and it's corresponding closing tag will be rendered as a table.</li>
        <li>&lt;tr&gt; -- This is a Table Row.</li>
        <li>&lt;td&gt; -- This will be data held within the table.</li>
        <li>&lt;th&gt; -- This is a heading for a table's column.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To edit code for the website, once you are on the page for the recipe, press the button that looks like a pencil. If this button is grayed out, it means that you are not logged into this website.<br>If you are not logged in, either log into my account, or create your own.</p>
    <p>Once you hit the pencil button, it will throw you into the editor for the code. In this window, scroll to the line that you want to edit, and type normally, ignoring the tags.</p>
    <p>If you need to insert a tag, Observe what tags have been used for similar items, and use that one. If you are unsure, please ask me!</p>
    <p>Once you are done, scroll to the bottom of the page to where it says "Commit changes"<br>It will ask for a breif description of what you have done to the page. Put a brief description such as:</p>
    <p><code>Updated Instructions for Clarity.</code></p>
    <p>Once your description is entered, press the button that says "Commit changes"<br>Please note that it will not update the website immediately. It should update within 3-5 minutes of the change being made.</p>
